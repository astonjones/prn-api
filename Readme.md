#PRN API

Stack:

- nodejs
- express
- mongoDB
- axios
- AWS EC2

This application is a simple api that handles leads that come from Facebook and Google.

Once a user submits information from Facebook/Google it makes a post request to the API
and that user data is then pushed to a mongo database. The data is also pushed into our
Vicidial dialer that "Pain Relief Network"(PRN) uses.
